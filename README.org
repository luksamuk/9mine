* Introduction

This is a console port of Minesweeper for Plan 9. The main goal was to build a
small game which would satisfactorily run on Plan 9, while taking advantage of
it to learn more about how to write C programs for this OS.

* Building

You can either build this program for Plan 9 (using ~mk~) or for Linux (using
~make~ and ~plan9port~). All you need to do is compile the ~9mine.c~ file.

Running ~mk~ or ~make~ on the folder should suffice, however pay close attention
to the compiler used so it runs on your architecture.
