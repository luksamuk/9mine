Console Minesweeper clone for Plan 9 from Bell Labs.

[[./9mine.gif]]

* Introduction

This is a console port of Minesweeper for Plan 9. The main goal was to build a
small game which would satisfactorily run on Plan 9, while taking advantage of
it to learn more about how to write C programs for this OS.

* Building

You can either build this program for Plan 9 (using ~mk~) or for Linux (using
~make~ and ~plan9port~). All you need to do is compile the ~9mine.c~ file.

Running ~mk~ or ~make~ on the folder should suffice, however pay close attention
to the compiler used so it runs on your architecture.

* Usage

The interface is pretty straightforward, as you can see on the gif. CLI will
guide you.

You can either step at an uncovered spot, put flags or doubts, and quit the
game.

Passing the ~-d~ flag will start the game in Debug Mode, so you'll get a Godview
option to see all numbers and bombs in runtime as well.

Quitting the game will point the bombs in your current field.

* Support

This program was tested on the following systems:

- Void Linux x86_64 (with plan9port);
- 9front "Run From Zone" (2018/09/09).

I did not test it on other Plan 9 distributions. If you do, give me a heads up.

* Issues

- [ ] Display flag and bomb count
- [ ] Add game winning logic

* Thanks

Thanks to Ricardo Lanziano ([[https://github.com/arpunk][arpunk]]) for explaining a lot about Plan 9 stuff to
me.
