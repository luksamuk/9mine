Console Minesweeper clone for Plan 9 from Bell Labs.

[[./9mine.gif]]

* Introduction

This is a console port of Minesweeper for Plan 9. The main goal was to build a
small game which would satisfactorily run on Plan 9, while taking advantage of
it to learn more about how to write C programs for this OS.

* Building

You can either build this program for Plan 9 (using ~mk~) or for Linux (using
~make~ and ~plan9port~). All you need to do is compile the ~9mine.c~ file.

Running ~mk~ or ~make~ on the folder should suffice, however pay close attention
to the compiler used so it runs on your architecture.

* Support

This program was tested on the following systems:

- Void Linux x86_64 (with plan9port);
- 9front "Run From Zone" (2018/09/09).

I did not test it on other Plan 9 distributions. If you do, give me a heads up.

* Issues

- [ ] Display flag and bomb count
- [ ] Add game winning logic

* License

This program is free software, distributed under the BSD 2-Clause License.
