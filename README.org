Console Minesweeper clone for Plan 9 from Bell Labs.

[[./9mine.gif]]

* Introduction

This is a console port of Minesweeper for Plan 9. The main goal was to build a
small game which would satisfactorily run on Plan 9, while taking advantage of
it to learn more about how to write C programs for this OS.

* Building

You can either build this program for Plan 9 (using ~mk~) or for Linux (using
~make~ and ~plan9port~). All you need to do is compile the ~9mine.c~ file.

** On 9front

~cd~ to the ~src~ folder, then run ~mk~. This will build a ~9mine~ application.

If you wish to install it to your system, just run ~mk install~. This will move
your application to your architecture's ~bin/games~ folder. You will then be able
to launch it using ~games/9mine~.

Cross-compilation is also possible through ~mk~. For example, to build the game
for amd64, just run ~objtype=amd64 mk~. The rest can be figured out from 9front's
FQA and the manpages.

** On Linux

Make sure you have ~plan9port~ installed, and ~9c~ / ~9l~ are present in your ~$PATH~.

~cd~ to the ~src~ folder, then run ~make~. This will produce a ~9mine~ executable for
your system's architecture.

No installation means were provided for Linux, however it should be portable
enough. The produced binary should have all Plan 9-related libraries statically
linked already.

* Usage

The interface is pretty straightforward, as you can see on the gif. CLI will
guide you.

You can either step at an uncovered spot, put flags or doubts, and quit the
game.

Passing the ~-d~ flag will start the game in Debug Mode, so you'll get a Godview
option to see all numbers and bombs in runtime as well.

Quitting the game will point the bombs in your current field.

* Support

This program was tested on the following systems:

- Void Linux x86_64 (with plan9port);
- 9front "Run From Zone" (2018/09/09).

I did not test it on other Plan 9 distributions. If you do, give me a heads up.

* Issues

- [ ] Display flag and bomb count
- [ ] Add game winning logic

* Thanks

Thanks to Ricardo Lanziano ([[https://github.com/arpunk][arpunk]]) for explaining a lot about Plan 9 stuff to
me.
